# What is WASDHook
Tool that captures your keyboard input and injects certain combination that allows you to almost bypass all of inertia

# How to install
Click this [download link](https://github.com/xXTurnerLP/WASDHook/releases/download/bin/WASDHook.zip) <br>
I recommend downloading from the link instead of compiling it yourself since the .exe is protected with VMP <br><br>
Extract the zip somewhere and run the .exe file and thats it really

# How it works
For example if you go from left to right, instead of going `left -> right` it will do `left -> forward -> right`. This little movement in the forward direction will bypass the inertia.
